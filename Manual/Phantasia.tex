\twocolumn[ \chapter{Setting Up}\label{Setting Up} ]

To play \textit{Phantasia}, you will need:

\begin{itemize}
\item An Atari console: the Atari ProSystem 7800, or Sears
  Tele-Games Video Arcade II
\item A TV or video display
\item A two-button joystick controller such as the ProLine controller
\item Optional,  but recommended:  A memory  device: an  AtariVox device
  with  (optional)  speakers or  headphones,  or  a MemCard  or  SaveKey
  device.
\item A  multi-cart with the  \textit{Phantasia} data  on it such  as the
  \textit{Concerto} cartridge
\end{itemize}

  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../Manual/AtariVox.jpeg}
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../Manual/SaveKey.jpeg}
  \end{center}
\end{figure*}

Set up your console with your TV or video display. Connect a joystick to
the \emph{left} controller port, and the memory
device (if any) to the \emph{right} controller port.

Finally, insert  the \textit{Phantasia}  game cartridge (with  the label
facing  up)  into  the  cartridge  slot,  and  turn  the  \textbf{Power}
\textbf{on}.

\section{Using a Gamepad}

A  SEGA  \ifdefined\TVNTSC{Genesis/}\fi{}MegaDrive   gamepad  (or  other
compatible controller) may also be  used. Use the \encircle{B} button as
the  \textbf{Left  Fire} button.  Use  the  \encircle{C} button  as  the
\textbf{Right Fire} button.

Your gamepad  \emph{must} be  plugged in \emph{before}  you turn  on the
power, or it will not work correctly.

\chapter{How To Play}

\section{Console Controls}

\subsection{Pause Button}

Press the  \textbf{Pause} button once  to pause  the game, and  again to
resume  playing.

\subsection{Select}

While you  are playing the  game, you  can use the  \textbf{Select}
button to access the game menu. See WRITEME for details.

\subsection{Reset}

While  you are  playing the  game,  press the  \textbf{Reset} button  to
access the Save or Quit option. See WRITEMe for details.

\subsection{Difficulty Switches}

You cannot erase a game in progress from your memory device (or un-erase
it) unless both Difficulty Switches are moved to the ``right'' (Advanced
or Expert position). To protect your  game from being erased, set either
one  of   the  Difficulty   Switches  to   the  ``left''   (Beginner  or
Novice) position.

The Difficulty Switches are located next to the controller ports.

\subsubsection*{Expert Mode}

The Left Difficulty Switch adjusts the  difficulty of the game. When the
Left Difficulty  Switch is in  the ``right'' (Advanced or  Expert) position,
monsters will do more damage in  their attacks. When the Left Difficulty
Switch is in  the ``left'' (Beginner or Novice) position,  monsters will do
their normal  amount of  damage. You  will also  earn double  points for
defeating monsters while in the ``right'' position.

\section{Start a Game}

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../Manual/Title\TV.png}
\end{center}

Once your  console is set  up and everything  is connected, turn  on the
\textbf{Power} switch. You'll  see the title screen appear.  If you have
an AtariVox device, you'll also hear the title spoken.

Press the \textbf{Left Fire} button to move to the Select Slot screen.

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../Manual/SelectSlot\TV.png}
\end{center}

Press the  \textbf{ Select} switch or  move the joystick up  and down to
choose   a  memory   slot\ifdefined\ATARIAGESAVE\else\footnote{Technical
  Note: The Slot  number chosen here is relative to  the three save game
  slots used by the \textit{Phantasia} game program. Each save game slot
  actually occupies 4  blocks on your memory device.}\fi  for your game.
There are three  memory slots possible. If someone has  already begun to
play \textit{Phantasia} in  a certain slot, your screen  will show their
name  and   avatar  (character).  If   a  slot  is  empty,   you'll  see
``\texttt{BEGIN}'' instead.

If you have a password, you can enter it instead by moving to the bottom
of the screen to PASSWORD and pressing \textbf{Left Fire}. See WRITEME

If someone has already \emph{won} the  game once, their name will appear
with a crown. See New Game Plus, page~\pageref{sec:NewGamePlus}.

\ifdefined\DEMO

\skip

This demo saves your progress in  the ``scratchpad'' area of your memory
device. It's possible that other  games might overwrite and destroy your
saved progress.  This is  just because  it's a demo,  and does  not have
a private area reserved for it.

\skip

\fi

When you have selected the slot you want to begin (or resume), press the
\textbf{Left Fire} button.

\fi

When you  first choose  to begin a  new game, you  can enter  your name.
Press  forward to  select  the  next letter;  pull  back  to select  the
previous letter.  Press left and right  to move to the  next or previous
position. You  can have up  to eight characters  for your name.  After eight
characters, the cursor will turn pink. Press the \textbf{Left Fire} button
to  proceed. Press  the  \textbf{Right  Fire} button  to  return to  the
\textbf{Select Slot} screen.

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../Manual/NameEntry\TV.png}
\end{center}

Next, you'll  get to create  your avatar (character). Push  the joystick
forward or pull back to move  between selections on the screen. Press the
\textbf{Left Fire} button to edit a  selection, then use the joystick to
make  a  choice.   Press  the  \textbf{Left  Fire}   button  to  confirm
a selection, or \textbf{Right Fire} button to abandon your change.

WRITEME

You'll have one  last chance to make sure that  you've entered your name
correctly and chosen the avatar you prefer. Push forward on
the joystick to select \texttt{CHANGE}  and edit your name and avatar
choices, or  pull back  to choose to  \texttt{BEGIN} your  adventure now.
Press the \textbf{Fire} button.

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../Manual/ConfirmNewGame\TV.png}
\end{center}

\fi

\section{Exploring Aclypt}

You'll begin  at your  home in  the village  of Solerno  in the  land of
Aclypt. Refer  to the  map (back  cover of this  manual) for  some ideas
about the  geography of Aclypt. Other  characters in the game  will also
give you advice about places you can go and things you can do.

The Map screen shows your current status at the top. In the map display,
you'll see the  current area in which you are  traveling. Guide yourself
using the joystick.

To interact  with objects  like doors  and people, walk  up to  them and
press the \textbf{Left Fire} button.  Some items or characters may react
to you simply walking up to them, as well.

To review your inventory, statistics,  and more, press the \textbf{Right
  Fire} button. WRITEME

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../Manual/Map\TV.png}
\end{center}

\section{Saving Your Progress}

The game is automatically saved to your memory device whenever you sleep
in your own  bed or an Inn.  You can also manually save  by pressing the
\textbf{Reset}  button  and choosing  \textbf{Save  and  Quit} from  the
pop-up menu.

You should leave your memory device connected at all times while playing
the game.

You   can   instead   use   a    password   to   save   your   progress.
Select  \textbf{Password} from  the \textbf{Reset}  menu to  obtain your
latest password.

\section{Conversations}

When you encounter  a person, they'll usually speak to  you. If you have
an AtariVox  connected, you'll hear  what they have  to say out  loud as
well.   After  you've   read  what   they   have  to   say,  press   the
\textbf{Left Fire} button.

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../Manual/Text\TV.png}
\end{center}

Some people will want to know what you have to say, in return. If that's
the case, you'll be given a choice of possible answers to give them.
Press forward or back on the joystick to select a response.

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../Manual/Inquire\TV.png}
\end{center}

If you  want to  review what the  person was asking,  you can  press the
\textbf{Right Fire} button to ask them to repeat themself instead.

When you've made your selection, press \textbf{Left Fire} to continue.

\section{Battling Monsters}

Monsters and other enemies plague the world of Aclypt.

\begin{figure*}[ht]
  \includegraphics[width=2\columnwidth]{../Manual/CombatControls.png}
\end{figure*}

When you  encounter enemies, you'll  see the Combat display.

Enemies  often travel  in groups,  so you  may see  more than  one enemy
facing you.

\section{Statistics}

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../Manual/StatsScreenshot\TV.png}
\end{center}

You can  press the \textbf{Right Fire}  button while viewing the  Map to
view  your party's  inventory  and statistics.  Press the  \textbf{Right
  Fire} button again to return to the previous screen.

There are three pages (screens) to view, displayed as ``tabs'' across the top of
the screen.  While the  tabs are  highlighted, press  left and  right to
change between pages.

The first page (screen) shows your  party's statistics. Pull back on the
joystick to highlight the name and portrait of 

\begin{description}
  
\item[\texttt{ATK.}] is the Grizzard's  \emph{attack} rating. This is the
  likelihood  that your  Grizzard  will  hit and  cause  damage when  it
  attacks a monster. Some Moves cause more damage than others.
  
\item[\texttt{DEF.}] is the Grizzard's  \emph{defend} rating. This is how
  likely your Grizzard is to avoid being hurt by a monster's Move.

\item[\texttt{HP}]  is  the  Grizzard's  \emph{hit  points}  or  health.
  When  monsters hit  your Grizzard,  this  value will  decrease. If  it
  reaches zero, your game is over.

\item[\texttt{MAX}]  is   the  Grizzard's  \emph{maximum   hit  points}.
  Your Grizzard can gain more hit points up to this amount.
  
\end{description}

Each of  these statistics can  be raised up to  a maximum of  99 points.
The Attack  rating, Defend  rating, or  Maximum Hit  Points may  go up
a bit after each monster that you defeat. The more skilled your Grizzard
becomes, the less often its levels will go up.

If you are currently in a  combat encounter, there may be Status Effects
that could change the effectiveness  of your Moves. These are \emph{not}
displayed on the statistics screen.

\section{Status Effects}\label{sec:StatusEffects}

A move can affect its target with Status Effects. There are six possible
Status Effects:

\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{SLEEP}] A  creature can not  move on their turn.  There is
  a 50\% chance of waking up.
\item[\texttt{ATK UP} / \texttt{ATK DN}] Raises or lowers the creature's
  effective Attack rating.
\item[\texttt{DEF UP} / \texttt{DEF DN}] Raises or lowers the creature's
  effective Defend rating.
\item[\texttt{MUDDLE}]  A  creature will  choose  its  moves at  random.
  There is a 50\% chance of clearing its mind.
\end{description}

These status effects last only the duration of one battle.

Also, these status effects cannot be  doubled up. For example: Once your
attack has been raised, it cannot be raised further.

\section{Scoring}

When you  defeat a monster, you'll  earn points. The number  of points
you earn  will increase as you  defeat more difficult monsters.  You can
also earn points for other some other actions you take in the game.

The score earned can be increased by:

\begin{itemize}
\item \ldots{}playing  in Expert  mode (by  setting the  Left Difficulty
  Switch to the ``A'' position)
\item \ldots{}defeating the larger version of a monster
\item  \ldots{}playing the  game  in  New Game  Plus  mode after  having
  defeated the final boss.
\end{itemize}

The score for  defeating a monster will be increased  to 2\times for any
one of these  factors, to 3\times for  any two of these  factors, and to
4\times if all three are true.

\section{Winning the Game}

You can  win the  game by  discovering what dark  forces are  behind the
onslaught of so many monsters, and defeating them.

\subsection*{New Game Plus}\label{sec:NewGamePlus}

Once  you've won  the game,  you can  keep playing!  On the  screen that
appears when you win, press \textbf{Game  Reset} on your console to save
your winning score and create a ``new game, plus.''

On your second time through, you'll  have both of the starting Phantasia
that you  had not  chosen the first  time, as well  as all  your trained
Phantasia to choose from. Monsters will become more difficult — but also
yield more points when defeated.

\section{Game Over}

If  you fail  in  your mission,  your  game is  over.  However, you  can
continue, and it'll be just as if you'd never failed in the first place.
You'll start over from the last Inn you visited, or your own home.

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../Manual/GameOver\TV.png}
\end{center}

\section{Starting Over}\label{Starting Your Adventure Over}

If you want to erase your progress and start again, you must:

\begin{itemize}
\item Go  to the Select Slot  screen, and press \textbf{Game  Select} or
  move  the joystick  left and  right until  you see  the slot  you want
  to erase.
\item Set both  of the Difficulty Switches on your  console to the ``A''
  (Advanced or Expert) position.
\item With your  joystick controller, pull back  and \emph{while holding
    the joystick back} press and hold the \textbf{Fire} button.
\item If you're \emph{sure} you want to erase your game's progress, then
  \emph{without}  letting  go  of  the \textbf{Fire}  button,  move  the
  joystick  forward. \ifdefined\DEMO  Your  game record  will be  erased
  \emph{immediately}. \fi
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../Manual/EraseSlot\TV.png}
\end{center}

Make sure  you want to  erase your game.  Press the joystick  forward or
back to make your choice, and press the \textbf{Fire} button.

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../Manual/ConfirmErase\TV.png}
\end{center}

The Left  Difficulty Switch is also  used to increase the  difficulty of
the game. After  erasing your progress, you may want  to return the Left
Difficulty Switch to your desired position.

\subsection{Protecting Your Game Record}

If  either of  your Difficulty  Switches is  in the  ``B'' (Beginner  or
Novice) position, you can't erase a game slot.

\subsection{Recovering an Erased Game}

If you have just erased a game's  progress, and no one has started a new
game using the same slot yet, you may be able to un-erase it.

To recover  an erased game,  follow the same steps  as if you  wanted to
erase  a game.  Press  left and  right  on the  joystick  to select  the
now-empty  slot  (the  screen  will say  ``\texttt{BEGIN}'').  Set  both
Difficulty Switches  to the  ``A'' (Advanced  or Export)  position, pull
back  on  the joystick,  and  \emph{while  holding  it back},  hold  the
\textbf{Fire} button.

If your  game's progress can be  recovered, you'll see that  the slot is
\texttt{ERASED} and you should also see your name appear. To recover the
game's progress, press forward on the joystick. The game will immediately
become available to resume.

Note that it  is \emph{not possible} to recover a  saved game's progress
once  a new  game has  been  started in  the  same memory  slot. If  you
accidentally start  a new game,  but have  not confirmed your  name yet,
\emph{turn off the power briefly}, then try the recovery steps above.

\section{Sad Face Screen}

If you  see the Sad  Face screen,  the game is  trying to tell  you that
there is a problem.

From here, you can press the \textbf{Game Reset} switch to return to the
Title Screen.

The game  has encountered an  error and cannot continue.  Please contact
\href{mailto:support@star-hope.org}{support@star-hope.org}           for
additional assistance. Send the code  number that appears on this screen
with your email.

\section{No voices}

On the title  screen, you'll hear the AtariVox announce  the name of the
game. If  you don't, make  sure that the  AtariVox is connected  and the
speakers (or headphones) are connected, powered on, and turned up.

Naturally,  there are  no  voices  when playing  \ifdefined\ATARIAGESAVE
without an AtariVox device. \else with a MemCard or SaveKey device. \fi
